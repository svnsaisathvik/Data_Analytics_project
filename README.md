## TechStack

 Tools used for this project

## How To Run

- To Run our file first we have to download power bi desktop app from the appstore.
- Or we can Run it on power bi website as well using the link
- The First Page consists of genre analysis.We can select any of the genre we want from the options in the genre section and the movies section will contain the movies in that genre.The details of the genre will be displayed in this page.
- After selecting movie and genre we go to the menu and click movie analysis.There again we will see the specific movie details with some parameters(imdb rating,meta_scores etc).
- Now,We will click on the actor and go to menu and choose actor analysis.
- This will lead to a page of actor's analysis where we have the genres in which actor has worked and the movies in which the actor has worked.It also has the best future actor director combo which can give good results in box office collection,IMDb rating,Meta_Score etc.
- We can also choose Multiple Genres/Movies  by control and clicking the options we want to choose. 
- NOTE:
- remember to select the movie and genre in the first page before going to the next pge.and as well select the actor to get the correct data.
